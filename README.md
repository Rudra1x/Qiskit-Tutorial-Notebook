Quantum Computing with Qiskit — Beginner to Advanced 🚀
📖 Project Description

This repository is a step-by-step learning journey through quantum computing using Qiskit.
It’s designed for students, educators, and self-learners who want to start from the basics of qubits and gates, and progress all the way to advanced quantum algorithms, quantum machine learning, and working with noisy hardware.

The project is organized as a series of Jupyter Notebooks, each covering a specific module with explanations, code, and hands-on experiments.

🗂️ Modules Overview

The learning path follows a structured roadmap:

Module 0: Introduction
Basics of quantum computing, qubits vs classical bits, installing and setting up Qiskit.

Module 1: Single-Qubit Foundations
Bloch sphere, single-qubit gates (X, Y, Z, H, S, T), measurements, superposition states.

Module 2: Multi-Qubit Systems
Tensor product states, CNOT/Controlled-Z/Swap, Bell state preparation.

Module 3: Entanglement & Quantum Phenomena
Bell states, GHZ states, teleportation, superdense coding, correlation experiments.

Module 4: Quantum Algorithms – Foundations
Deutsch–Jozsa, Bernstein–Vazirani, Grover’s search, Shor’s algorithm (toy example).

Module 5: Intermediate Algorithms & Applications
Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), Phase Estimation, QAOA (optimization), VQE (chemistry).

Module 6: Quantum Machine Learning (QML)
Feature maps, quantum kernels, QSVM, hybrid quantum-classical neural networks.

Module 7: Quantum Hardware & Noise
Aer simulator vs real IBM hardware, noise models, error mitigation techniques.

Module 8: Advanced Topics & Future Directions
Quantum advantage, cryptography, recent breakthroughs, further learning resources.
